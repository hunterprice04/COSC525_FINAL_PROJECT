- [Inverse Graphics GAN: Learning to Generate 3D Shapes from Unstructured 2D Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12674.pdf)

# Image Classification
## OpenAI CLIP
https://blog.roboflow.com/openai-clip/
https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-use-openai-clip/

## Use-Case:
- Feed in original image => get text representation of image.
  - For example, if the input is an image of dog on a lawn, the output is "image of a dog on a lawn".

# Image Generation
## OpenAI DALL-E
https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/
https://github.com/openai/dall-e

## Use-Case:
- The user edits the original text representation => this model generates a new image.
  - For example, "image of a dog on a street" => model generates corresponding image

## Performance and Limitations

The heavy compression from the encoding process results in a noticeable loss of detail in the reconstructed images. This
renders it inappropriate for applications that require fine-grained details of the image to be preserved.
