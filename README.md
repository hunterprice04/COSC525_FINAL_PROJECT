## CS525 Final Project

## TODO:

- Find papers of smaller models to compare results
- Look into metric for the complexity of text (e.g. 5th grader vs 12th grader, etc)
	- Include this text comprehension metric in the paper
- https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/serving/rest_simple

# Ideas:
- Losses:
  - Categorical cross-entropy?
  - Cosine similarity?
- Look through implementations of different models at: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/src/transformers
- 


## Data
- Doesn't matter rn we can test on anything and choose final data later

## Repos:

- GitHub Repos
- GitHub - openai/human-eval: Code for the paper "Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code"
- GitHub - kimiyoung/transformer-xl
- GitHub - openai/gpt-2: Code for the paper "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"
