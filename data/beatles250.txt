a day in the life
i read the news today oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph.
he blew his mind out in a car
he didn’t notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure
if he was from the house of lords.
i saw a film today oh boy
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book.
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed,
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
and looking up i noticed i was late.
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
somebody spoke and i went into a dream
i read the news today oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall.
i'd love to turn you on
a hard day's night
it’s been a hard da'’s night, and i been working like a dog
it’s been a hard day's night, i should be sleeping like a log
but when i get home to you i'll find the things that you do
will make me feel alright
you know i work all day to get you money to buy you things
and it’s worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
so why on earth should i moan, 'cause when i get you alone
you know i feel ok
when i'm home everything seems to be right
when i'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight
owww!
so why on earth should i moan, 'cause when i get you alone

a little help from my friends

would you stand up and walk out on me.
lend me your ears and i'll sing you a song,
and i'll try not to sing out of key.

a taste of honey
a taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
i dream of your first kiss, and then,
i feel upon my lips again,
a taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
i will return, yes i will return,
i’ll come back for the honey and you.
yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
there lingers still, 'though we're far apart,
that taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
i will return, yes i will return,
i'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.
across the universe
words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
they slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
possessing and caressing me.
jai guru de va om
nothing's gonna change my world,
nothing's gonna change my world.
images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
that call me on and on across the universe,
thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
tumble blindly as they make their way
across the universe
jai guru de va om
nothing’s gonna change my world,
nothing’s gonna change my world.
sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
through my open views inviting and inciting me
limitless undying love which shines around me like a
million suns, it calls me on and on
across the universe
jai guru de va om
nothing’s gonna change my world,
nothing’s gonna change my world.
