a day in the life
i read the news today oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph.
he blew his mind out in a car
he didn’t notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure
if he was from the house of lords.
i saw a film today oh boy
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book.
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed,
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
and looking up i noticed i was late.
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
somebody spoke and i went into a dream
i read the news today oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall.
i'd love to turn you on
a hard day's night
it’s been a hard da'’s night, and i been working like a dog
it’s been a hard day's night, i should be sleeping like a log
but when i get home to you i'll find the things that you do
will make me feel alright
you know i work all day to get you money to buy you things
and it’s worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
so why on earth should i moan, 'cause when i get you alone
you know i feel ok
when i'm home everything seems to be right
when i'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight
owww!

across the universe
words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
they slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
possessing and caressing me.
jai guru de va om
nothing's gonna change my world,

thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
tumble blindly as they make their way
across the universe
jai guru de va om
nothing’s gonna change my world,
nothing’s gonna change my world.
sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
through my open views inviting and inciting me
limitless undying love which shines around me like a

across the universe

since she's been gone i want no one to talk to me.
it’s not the same but i'm to blame, it's plain to see.
so go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.
i can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
it’s just not right when every night i'm all alone.
i've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
i know i'll never be the same if i don't get her back again.
because i know she'll always be the only girl for me.
but 'till she’s here please don't come near, just stay away.
i'll let you know when she's come home. until that day,
don’t come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.

don't let me down, don't let me down.
don't let me down, don't let me down.
i'm in love for the first time.
don't you know it's gonna last.
i'’s a love that lasts forever,
it's a love that had no past.

don't let me down, don't let me down.
don't let me down, don't let me down.
don't pass me by
i listen for your footsteps
coming up the drive
listen for your footsteps
but they don't arrive
waiting for your knock dear
on my old front door
i don't hear it
does it mean you don't love me any more.
i hear the clock a’ticking
on the mantel shelf
see the hands a’moving
but i'm by myself
i wonder where you are tonight
and why i'm by myself
i don't see you
does it mean you don't love me any more.
don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
'cause you know darling i love only you
you'll never know it hurt me so
how i hate to see you go
don't pass me by don’t make me cry
i'm sorry that i doubted you
i was so unfair
you were in a car crash
and you lost your hair
