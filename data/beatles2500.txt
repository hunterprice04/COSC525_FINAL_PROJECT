a day in the life
i read the news today oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph.
he blew his mind out in a car
he didn’t notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure
if he was from the house of lords.
i saw a film today oh boy
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book.
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed,
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
and looking up i noticed i was late.
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
somebody spoke and i went into a dream
i read the news today oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall.
i'd love to turn you on
a hard day's night
it’s been a hard da'’s night, and i been working like a dog

but when i get home to you i'll find the things that you do
will make me feel alright
you know i work all day to get you money to buy you things
and it’s worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
so why on earth should i moan, 'cause when i get you alone
you know i feel ok
when i'm home everything seems to be right
when i'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

across the universe
words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,

pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
possessing and caressing me.

thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
tumble blindly as they make their way
across the universe
jai guru de va om
nothing’s gonna change my world,

sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
through my open views inviting and inciting me

across the universe

i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where will it go
i'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
and kept my mind from wandering
where will it go
and it really doesn’t matter if i'm wrong
i'm right
where i belong i’m right
where i belong.
see the people standing there who disagree and never win
and wonder why they don’t get in my door.
i'm painting my room in the colourful way
and when my mind is wandering
there i will go.
and it really doesn't matter if
i'm wrong i'm right
where i belong i'm right
where i belong.
silly people run around they worry me
and never ask me why they don't get past my door.
i'm taking the time for a number of things
that weren’t important yesterday
and i still go.
i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where it will go.
for no one
your day breaks, your mind aches
you find that all the words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
she wakes up, she makes up
she takes her time and doesn’t feel she has to hurry
she no longer needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years!
you want her, you need her
and yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
you think she needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years!
you stay home, she goes out
she says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
she doesn't need him
your day breaks, your mind aches
there will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
you won't forget her
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years!

but now these days are gone, i’m not so self assured,
now i find i've changed my mind and opened up the doors.
help me if you can, i’m feeling down
and i do appreciate you being round.
help me, get my feet back on the ground,
won't you please, please help me.
and now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
my independence seems to vanish in the haze.
but every now and then i feel so insecure,
i know that i just need you like i've never done before.
help me if you can, i'm feeling down
and i do appreciate you being round.
help me, get my feet back on the ground,
won't you please, please help me.

taking my time
lying there and staring at the ceiling
waiting for a sleepy feeling...
please, don’t spoil my day, i’m miles away
and after all i’m only sleeping
keeping an eye on the world going by my window
taking my time
when i wake up early in the morning
lift my head, i’m still yawning
when i’m in the middle of a dream
stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)
please, don’t wake me, no, don’t shake me
leave me where i am - i’m only sleeping
i’m so tired
i’m so tired, i haven’t slept a wink
i’m so tired, my mind is on the blink
i wonder should i get up and fix myself a drink
no,no,no.
i’m so tired i don’t know what to do
i’m so tired my mind is set on you
i wonder should i call you but i know what you’d do
you’d say i’m putting you on
but it’s no joke, it’s doing me harm
you know i can’t sleep, i can’t stop my brain
you know it’s three weeks, i’m going insane
you know i’d give you everything i’ve got
for a little peace of mind
i’m so tired, i’m feeling so upset
although i’m so tired i’ll have another cigarette
and curse sir walter raleigh
he was such a stupid guest.
i’ve got a feeling
i’ve got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
oh yeah, oh yeah.
i’ve got a feeling, a feeling i can’t hide
oh no. oh no, oh no,
yeah i’ve got a feeling.
oh please believe me, i’d hate to miss the train
oh yeah, oh yeah.
and if you leave me i won’t be late again
oh no, oh no, oh no.
yeah i’ve got a feeling yeah.
all these years i’ve been wandering around,
wondering how come nobody told me
all that i was looking for was somebody
who looked like you.
ev’rybody had a hard year
ev’rybody had a good time
ev’rybody had a wet dream,
ev’rybody saw the sunshine
oh yeah, oh yeah.
ev’rybody had a good year,
ev’rybody let their hair down,
ev’rybody pulled their socks up,
ev’rybody put their foot down.
oh yeah, oh yeah.
i’ve just seen a face
i’ve just seen a face,
i can’t forget the time or place
where we just meet.
she’s just the girl for me
and want all the world to see
we’ve met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m’mmm-mmm.
had it been another day
i might have looked the other way
and i’d have never been aware.
but as it is i’ll dream of her
tonight, di-di-di-di’n’di.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
i have never known
the like of this, i’ve been alone
and i have missed things
and kept out of sight
but other girls were never quite
like this, da-da-n’da-da’n’da.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
i’ve just seen a face,
i can’t forget the time or place
where we just meet.
she’s just the girl for me
and want all the world to see
we’ve met, mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
oh, falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
if i fell
if i fell in love with you
would you promise to be true
and help me understand
cause i’ve been in love before
and i found that love was more
than just holding hands
if i give my heart to you
i must be sure
from the very start
that you would love me more than her
if i trust in you oh please
don’t run and hide
if i love you too oh please
don’t hurt my pride like her
cause i couldn’t stand the pain
and i would be sad if our new love was in vain
so i hope you see that i
would love to love you
and that she will cry
when she learns we are two
if i fell in love with you
if i needed someone
if i needed someone to love
you’re the one that i’d be thinking of
if i needed someone
if i had some more time to spend
then i guess i’d be with you my friend
if i needed someone
had you come some other day
it might not have been like this
but you see now i’m too much in love
carve your number on my wall
and maybe you will get a call from me
if i needed someone
ah, ah, ah, ah
if i had some more time to spend
then i guess i’d be with you my friend
if i needed someone
had you come some other day
it might not have been like this
but you see now i’m too much in love
carve your number on my wall
and maybe you will get a call from me
if i needed someone
ah, ah
in my life
there are places i’ll remember
all my life though some have changed
some forever not for better
some have gone and some remain
all these places have their moments
with lovers and friends i still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life i’ve loved them all
but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new
though i know i’ll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i’ll often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
though i know i’ll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i’ll often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
in my life i love you more
it won’t be long
ev’ry night when ev’rybody has fun,
here am i sitting all on my own,
it won’t be long yeh, yeh,
it won’t be long yeh, yeh,
it won’t be long yeh, yeh,
till i belong to you.
since you left me i’m so alone,
now you’re coming, you’re coming home,
i’ll be good like i know i should,
you’re coming home, you’re coming home.
ev’ry night the tears come down from my eyes,
ev’ry day i’ve done nothing but cry.
it won’t be long yeh, yeh.
since you left me i’m so alone,
now you’re coming, you’re coming home,
i’ll be good like i know i should,
you’re coming home, you’re coming home.
ev’ry day we’ll be happy, i know,
now i know that you won’t leave me no more.
it won’t be long yeh, yeh.
it’s all too much
it’s all too much, it’s all too much
when i look into your eyes, your love is there for me
and the more i go inside, the more there is to see
it’s all too much for me to take
the love that’s shining all around you
everywhere, it’s what you make
for us to take, it’s all too much
floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
makes no difference where you are or where you’d like to be
it’s all too much for me to take
the love that’s shining all around here
all the world’s a birthday cake,
so take a piece but not too much
set me on a silver sun, for i know that i’m free
show me that i’m everywhere, and get me home for tea
it’s all to much for me to see
a love that’s shining all around here
the more i am, the less i know
and what i do is all too much
it’s all too much for me to take
the love that’s shining all around you
everywhere, it’s what you make
for us to take, it’s all too much
it’s too much.....it’s too much
too much too much too much (fade to end)
it’s only love
i get high when i see you go by
my oh my.
when you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
butterflies
why am i so shy when i’m beside you?
it’s only love and that is all,
why should i feel the way i do?
it’s only love, and that is all,
but it’s so hard loving you.
is it right that you and i should fight
ev’ry night?
just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
very bright.
haven’t i the right to make it up girl?
it’s only love and that is all,
why should i feel the way i do?
it’s only love, and that is all
but it’s so hard loving you
yes it’s so hard loving you -- loving you.
julia
half of what i say is meaningless
but i say it just to reach you, julia
julia, julia, oceanchild, calls me
so i sing a song of love, julia
julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
so i sing a song of love, julia
her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
in the sun
julia, julia, morning moon, touch me
